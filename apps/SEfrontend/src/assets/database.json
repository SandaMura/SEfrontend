	  "destinationName": "Kotor, Montenegro",
	  "description": "Weighing in at just two-thirds the size of Wales and with a population of less than a million, the tiny Balkan state of Montenegro still flies under the radar for many European visitors – but just a few hours’ drives from better-known Dubrovnik, UNESCO-protected Kotor shares many of its Croatian neighbour’s charms. Circled by ancient stone walls, its warren of honey-dipped, maze-like streets was intentionally built in such a way to confuse invaders (the Venetian empire ruled her for over 400 years), and there’s a delicious sense that the city was frozen in time. The crystal-clear bay edging Kotor is high on natural drama – flanked by steep, brooding limestone and granite mountains plunging straight into the sea, it could easily masquerade as a Norwegian fjord. While you’re here, jump in a boat and zip out into the water to peek inside Our Lady of the Rocks, a beautiful church squirrelled away on a floating island in front of the city – and make time to scramble up Fortress San Giovanni for a birds’ eye view of the old town’s terracotta rooftops. Timing your visit with the start of the summer yachting season adds an extra layer of fun when glamorous crowds descend on Kotor’s lively waterfront restaurants before cove-hopping along the unspoiled Bay of Kotor.",

	  "countryName": "Syracuse, Sicily",
	  "description": "In its Greco-Roman heyday, Syracuse was the world's largest and most important ancient city – and today, it’s home to some of Europe’s most celebrated archaeological ruins. But this diminutive, sun-drenched Sicilian city (a few years ago, it recorded Europe’s highest-ever temperature) is far more than the sum of its historical parts. With Mount Etna smouldering quietly in the background, glassy Porto Grande Bay gently curling around the city and a beguiling blend of Baroque, Greek, Roman and Medieval architecture packed into the narrow streets, the setting itself does much of the talking. A quick hop across the water leads you to Ortigia, Syracuse’s historical centre, where the daily food market is a hit on the senses and the contemporary restaurants draw critical acclaim. In the summer, rise early to snaffle a spot on the small pebbly beach at Spiaggia di Cala Rossa, or settle in for a coffee and some people-watching in glittering Piazza Duomo. Following your nose is the only real way to explore, but whatever you do, make sure you find your way to Antica Giudecca – their jumbo arancini balls are hands down the best street food in town.",

	  "description": "San Sebastian may be Spain’s undisputed culinary capital, but another unsung hero is clicking at its heels. Valencia is the birthplace of paella, Spain’s national dish – and ringed by orange groves bursting with sunshine-sweet citrus fruits, lauded for its bounty of fresh seafood and currently gearing up to host 2023’s World 50 Best Restaurant Awards – this city certainly isn’t lagging far behind. With a fraction of the tourist numbers of Madrid or Barcelona, it’s easy to fall for Valencia’s small-town vibe and big-town buzz. Boundary-pushing architecture sits side-by-side with the city’s gothic-meets-baroque cathedral. At the same time, star attractions include the futuristic City of Arts and Sciences and Europe’s biggest and best aquarium, harbouring Patagonian sea lions, beluga whales and black-tipped reef sharks. In the fifties, a devastating flood wrought havoc on the city and forced the government to reroute the river wending its way around the centre – in its place, the Turia Gardens is a 9km oasis of waving palms, boating lakes, manicured gardens and bicycle routes, making two wheels in this city more popular than four. There are beaches: a thrilling mix of pretty coves kissing the edge of old fishermen’s towns and vast open swathes of golden sand with nightlife dotted along the shore.",

	  "description": "Most people think of Mallorca and picture the Balearic beauty’s paradisical beaches and seductive mountain villages. But it’s well worth treating the island’s chic capital as more than an airport launchpad. Rising out of the harbour in a rush of golden stone and extraordinary Moorish architecture, Palma feels deliciously grown-up – and a world away from the brouhaha of Mallorca’s beach clubs and party towns. Its gothic cathedral is nothing short of an architectural wonder, and its raft of artisan interiors shops, kooky art galleries, lively rooftop bars, and experiential restaurants (Vandal, the city’s top table to book, is helmed by ex-Noma culinary wizard Bernabe Caravotta) are reason enough to visit alone. And though they may not be among the island’s most prolific, the beaches here still warrant a mention: palm-shaded Ca’n Pere Antoni stretches for miles along the city promenade, while locals prefer to head to the charming fishing village of Portixol. Just a 10-minute ride out of town, it’s a blissful spot for an early evening dip, followed by dinner at one of the homespun seafood restaurants stacked up along the shore.",
